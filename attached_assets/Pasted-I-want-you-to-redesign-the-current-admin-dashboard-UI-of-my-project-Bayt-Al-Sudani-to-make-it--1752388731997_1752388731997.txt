I want you to **redesign the current admin dashboard UI** of my project "Bayt Al-Sudani" to make it more **modern, professional, and visually elegant**, while keeping the Sudanese cultural identity.

Please apply the following improvements to the HTML and CSS files inside the admin dashboard template:

🔧 1. **Layout & Structure:**
- Use a clean and modern layout with a proper grid or flexbox system.
- Add responsive design using CSS media queries or Bootstrap/Tailwind (if available).
- Place KPI cards in a balanced grid layout with equal spacing.
- Group related items (statistics, quick actions, recent activity) into distinct visual blocks.

🎨 2. **Visual Design:**
- Use a consistent color palette inspired by Sudanese identity:
  - Primary: Dark Green (#006400)
  - Secondary: Gold (#C8B560)
  - Background: Light Beige (#FDF6EC)
- Add subtle shadows and border radius to cards and containers.
- Replace flat cards with modern, elevated cards with hover effects.

📱 3. **Typography:**
- Use an elegant Arabic-friendly font like **Tajawal** or **Cairo** (import from Google Fonts).
- Ensure proper RTL (right-to-left) support.
- Apply consistent font sizes, line heights, and weight.

🧩 4. **Navigation and Interaction:**
- Add a fixed top navigation bar with:
  - App title/logo: "البيت السوداني"
  - Profile dropdown (with name/avatar)
  - Notification icon
- Add a sidebar or bottom navigation for quick access to:
  - Dashboard, Users, Products, Stores, Services, Jobs, Ads, Settings

⚙️ 5. **User Experience (UX):**
- Add visual feedback on button hover/click.
- Show friendly empty states if data is 0 (e.g., "No services yet").
- Add timestamps in human-readable form ("5 mins ago", "Today").

📈 6. **Optional Enhancements:**
- Add icon animations (e.g., using Font Awesome + hover scale).
- If possible, allow theme switching (light/dark).
- Use reusable CSS classes for cards, buttons, and sections.

💡 Notes:
- Don't change the business logic or functionality.
- Focus only on improving the **frontend design and layout**.
- Keep code modular and clean (separate CSS if needed).
- All HTML edits are under `templates/admin/` and styles in `static/css/`.

Start by rewriting `dashboard.html` and its linked CSS file as a professional admin dashboard screen based on these instructions.
